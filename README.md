# NorthCitadel
NorthCitadel is a universal bot management system for one of the games, made by team of coworkers.

# Why
Just for fun in game. There are a lot of people worked with this solution. Keks-n, Badiboy, Name, Snapp, many other users. So in the two years I'm deploying this old project in the memory of our coworking.
